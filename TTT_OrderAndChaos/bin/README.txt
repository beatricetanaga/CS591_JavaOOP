--How to play--

Tic Tac Toe:
First player will be defaulted to play with the 'X' checker, and second player will play with the 'O' checker. You will be prompted to type in two numbers (ex. 1 2) corresponding to the row and column where you would like to place your next move, then hit enter. Rows and columns are labeled on the board for your convenience. If an invalid input is given, game will not proceed and will wait for a valid input to be typed in. 

Order and Chaos:
Player will be asked to choose between the roles of Oder and Chaos. The player who has chosen Order should proceed to play the first move. During each turn, both players will be asked which cell he/she would like to place his/her move. He/she will also be asked if they would like to place a 'X' or a 'O' checker. If 5 'X's or 'O's are discovered within the board, Order will be notified that he/she has won. If the board fills up before that happens, Chaos will be notified that he/she has won. If an invalid input is given, the game will not proceed and will wait for a valid input to be typed in.
